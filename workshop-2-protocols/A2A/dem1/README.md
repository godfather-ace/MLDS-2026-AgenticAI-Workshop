# 🤝 Demo 1 — Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol with CrewAI

> **MLDS 2026 AgenticAI Workshop | Workshop 2: Agentic Protocols**

This demo illustrates the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol** in action — a lightweight HTTP-based standard that allows independent AI agents to discover each other, communicate, and collaborate without being coupled to the same framework or codebase.

---

## 📌 What This Demo Does

Two agents work together across separate processes:

| Agent | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Analyst Agent** | `analyst_agent.py` | A **CrewAI-powered** FastAPI server that analyzes text input and returns 3 key trends |
| **Visualiser Agent** | `visualiser_agent.py` | A standalone client that calls the Analyst via A2A and renders an interactive Plotly chart |

**The Flow:**

```
User Prompt
    │
    ▼
Visualiser Agent
    │  HTTP POST /execute  (A2A call)
    ▼
Analyst Agent (CrewAI)
    │  Returns 3 trends
    ▼
Visualiser Agent
    │  Renders Interactive Chart
    ▼
Browser Window (Plotly Dark Theme)
```

## 🧠 A2A Protocol — Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Agent Discovery via Agent Card
The Analyst Agent exposes a **well-known discovery endpoint** at:

```
GET /.well-known/agent-card.json
```

This returns metadata about the agent — its name, description, capabilities, and execution endpoint — allowing any other agent to discover and integrate with it dynamically.

```json
{
  "name": "crewai_analyst",
  "description": "An agent that analyzes data using CrewAI.",
  "capabilities": ["data_analysis"],
  "endpoint": "/execute"
}
```

### 2. Agent Execution via Standard HTTP
Any agent (regardless of framework) can invoke the Analyst by posting to:

```
POST /execute
Content-Type: application/json

{ "input": "Analyze the growth of Generative AI in 2025." }
```

This decoupling is the heart of A2A — **the caller doesn't need to know or care that CrewAI is running underneath**.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12
- An OpenAI API key (used by CrewAI under the hood)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/godfather-ace/MLDS-2026-AgenticAI-Workshop.git
cd MLDS-2026-AgenticAI-Workshop/workshop-2-protocols/A2A/dem1
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn crewai plotly requests python-dotenv
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `dem1/` directory:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Demo

### Step 1 — Start the Analyst Agent (A2A Server)

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python analyst_agent.py
```

The Analyst Agent will start on **http://localhost:8001**.

You can verify it's running by visiting:
```
http://localhost:8001/.well-known/agent-card.json
```

### Step 2 — Run the Visualiser Agent (A2A Client)

Open a **second terminal** and run:

```bash
python visualiser_agent.py
```

The Visualiser will:
1. Call the Analyst Agent via the A2A `/execute` endpoint
2. Print the trend analysis to the console
3. Open an **interactive Plotly chart** in your browser

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The Visualiser agent is **completely framework-agnostic** — it only knows the A2A contract (an HTTP endpoint that accepts `input` and returns `output`). You could swap CrewAI for LangChain, AutoGen, or any other framework on the server side and the client would not need to change at all.
